Basic Patterns in Java
This repository contains examples and explanations of basic design patterns implemented in Java. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. Understanding these patterns can help developers write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code.

Introduction
In this repository, you will find simple and clear examples of various design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern is accompanied by a detailed explanation of its purpose, structure, and usage.

Patterns Covered
The following design patterns are covered in this repository:

Singleton Pattern: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Decorator Pattern: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
Composite Pattern: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
Each pattern directory contains a Java class file demonstrating the pattern in action along with a detailed explanation in the comments.

Usage
To use these examples, simply clone or download this repository and open it in your favorite Java IDE. Each pattern is implemented in a separate Java class file within its respective directory. You can run and experiment with these examples to understand how each pattern works and how it can be applied to your own projects.

Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or additional examples for any of the covered patterns, feel free to open a pull request.
